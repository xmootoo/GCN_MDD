# Applying Graph Convolution Networks to EEG Data for Diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder

Exploring different types of neural networks to predict Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) from EEG data, trained and tested on the HUSM dataset. These models include:

* 7-layer basic neural network
* Convolutional neural network
* (Graph Attention Network)
* (Graph Convolutional Network)
