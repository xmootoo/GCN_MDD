# Applying Graph Convolution Networks to EEG Data for Diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder

Exploring different neural network architectures to predict Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) from EEG data, trained and tested on the HUSM dataset. We test the following models:

* 8-layer basic neural network
* Convolutional neural network
